## Vipps MobilePay partner terms and conditions

Version: 1.0.0

These terms and conditions are valid from 1 September 2023.

### 1. SCOPE

The Vipps MobilePay Partner Terms and Conditions ("the Partner Terms") is a legally binding contract between Partner and Vipps MobilePay entered into when Partner accepts the Partner Terms.

The Partner Terms regulate the obligations connected to the Partner's distribution, installment, integration and support for use of the Products for relevant target groups and Merchants. The Partner Terms supersede any previous agreement between Vipps MobilePay and the Partner governing the same subject matter.

The Products are dependent on Vipps MobilePay maintaining the required license(s) with the relevant Financial Supervisory Authorities.

Vipps MobilePay and the Partner are each referred to as a "Party" and jointly as "Parties".

### 2. DEFINITIONS

The following definitions are used in the Partner Terms

**API(s):** application programming interface(s) for integrating Merchant solutions with the Vipps MobilePay Products as defined in the Documentation ([Vipps MobilePay Technical Documentation](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/)), including the Management API.

**Confidential Information:** (i) information concerning Vipps MobilePay, including information regarding its employees, products, services, customers, suppliers, contractors and other third parties conducting business with Vipps MobilePay and (ii) any information which according to applicable law is confidential. Information does not have to be marked as confidential in order to qualify as confidential.

**Documentation** : technical documentation governing the preparation, installment, integration, management and use of the Products delivered to the Merchant, including API documentation. Documentation is available on the Vipps MobilePay website.

**Management Keys:** keys that provide access to the Management API, which only allow management of sales units but cannot be used to make payments as described at the Documentation ([Management Keys](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner/partner-keys/#types-of-partner-keys)).

**Merchant:** a corporate customer that has executed a merchant agreement with Vipps MobilePay and uses any Product delivered through a Partner.

**Merchant Terms:** the at all times applicable terms and conditions applicable to Vipps MobilePay's Products, available at Vipps MobilePay's website.

**Partner:** a legal person, registered in the Norwegian Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities or an equivalent public register within the EEA-area, who offers preparation, installment and integration of the Products delivered to Merchants who manages transactions on behalf of Merchants. Partner can be a platform partner or a reseller as defined in the Documentation ([Partners](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-partner#partner-types)).

**Partner Keys:** keys that allow Partner to use its own API credentials to manage sales units using the Management API, and to make API requests on behalf of the Partner's Merchants, as described in the Documentation ([Partner Keys](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-partner/partner-keys/)).

**Plugins:** software components as described in the Documentation ([Plugins](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/vipps-plugins/)), including SDKs.

**Products:** all payment services and ancillary services provided to Merchants by Vipps MobilePay and included in the product portfolio described at [vippsmobilepay.com](https://vippsmobilepay.com/) as amended from time to time by Vipps MobilePay. That notwithstanding, pass-through services where Vipps MobilePay facilitates acceptance of a payment made with a payment instrument issued by a third party (currently Vipps PSP and MobilePay Online) are not included in Products.

**Sales Unit** : physical and/or online point of sales capable of receiving payments with a Product, created by a Merchant.

**Vipps MobilePay** : means Vipps MobilePay AS, Postboks 9236 Grønland 0134 Oslo, Org. 918 713 867, including any local branch or group entity. Vipps MobilePay is a Norwegian registered payment service provider ("betalingsforetak") with license from the Ministry of Finance ("Finansdepartementet") and is subject to monitoring from the Financial Authority ("Finanstilsynet") in accordance with Financial Institutions Act ("finansforetaksloven") §§ 2-10 to 2-11.

Partner is obligated to integrate the Products in accordance with the Documentation and the at all time applicable requirements and guidelines provided by Vipps MobilePay and the [Documentation](README.md). The integration is final and ready to go "live" when Partner has completed the checklist, as described in the Documentation ([Partners](README.md#finishing-the-integration-and-going-live)).

A Partner who will make payments on behalf of the Partner’s Merchant(s) can get access to Partner Keys by entering into a specific Partner Key Agreement with Vipps MobilePay. Partner thereby gets a set of API keys which work for all the Partner’s Merchants.

### 6. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF INTEGRATION

#### Plugins

1. Vipps MobilePay will on an ongoing basis and in its sole discretion assess what platforms it offers Plugins for and when it is considered beneficial to initiate necessary work to establish official Plugins for a platform.

If the errors have not been corrected within 30 days after the written notice, Vipps MobilePay is entitled to terminate the Partner Terms for cause in accordance with section Termination.

    If a Partner does not update Partner solution as instructed by Vipps MobilePay, Vipps MobilePay does not guarantee the functionality of the Products. When Vipps MobilePay phases out an API, or a part of an API (an endpoint), the previous version will function for a period of time as described in [API Lifecycle](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/api-lifecycle/).

    Plugins or integrations that a Partner has developed based on the API may stop functioning when a specific API is phased out, or it is materially changed.

1. Partner is obligated to upgrade to the newest versions of APIs after they have been made available by Vipps MobilePay. The updates are described in the [API Lifecycle](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/api-lifecycle/).

1. If Partner cannot answer an inquiry, Partner must use Vipps MobilePay's support resources (second-line support).

1. Partner shall not refer a Merchant to Vipps MobilePay, but contact Vipps MobilePay on behalf of Merchant.

If errors, as regulated in Partner Terms, have not been corrected within 30 days' notice, Vipps MobilePay is entitled to terminate the Partner Terms for cause with immediate effect upon written notice.

In the event of a Party's material breach of the Partner Terms, the other Party is entitled to terminate the Partner Terms for cause with immediate effect.

Further, Vipps MobilePay is entitled to terminate the Partner Terms for cause with immediate effect if the Partner enters into bankruptcy, becomes part of a mandatory estate management or similar or is liquidated or removed from the company registry.

### 10. EFFECT OF TERMINATION

In the event of termination of the Partner Terms, Partner must in collaboration with Vipps MobilePay provide the Merchant with information of termination, what the termination means for the Merchant, and what the Merchant can do in order to continue using the Products. If necessary, Vipps MobilePay can notify the Merchants directly.

After termination of the Partner Terms, Partner shall not present or otherwise market itself as partner of Vipps MobilePay. This includes amongst others that Partner must remove all references to Vipps MobilePay, including names, logos, trademarks and other business marks, from its digital spaces and from marketing material.

The Parties must impose confidentiality obligations on employees, contractors and consultants which covers the requirements for confidentiality in the Partner Terms.

The confidentiality obligation does not apply to information which is (i) public, other than by breach of the Partner Terms, (ii) received by a Party who lawfully acquired it from a third-party and/or (iii) independently developed by a Party without access to Confidential Information.

The Partner shall upon Vipps MobilePay's request and in Vipps MobilePay's sole discretion immediately return all Confidential Information, together with copies and/or reproductions or delete and destroy all Confidential Information, including copies and reproductions, and provide Vipps MobilePay with a statement confirming the deletion.

This confidentiality undertaking shall survive any termination of the Partner Terms and shall remain in force during a period of three (3) years thereafter.

### 14. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Vipps MobilePay grants to the Partner a limited, non-exclusive and revocable right to market, distribute and promote the Products, as long as the Partner Terms are valid and in force, in the context of the Partner's business related to preparation, installment and integration services provided to the Merchants.

Vipps MobilePay retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Vipps MobilePay intellectual property rights, including but not limited to name(s), brand(s), logo(s), APIs, Plugins, Documentation and Products, including without limitation the Vipps and/or MobilePay application and all other all software used to provide the products and all graphics, user interfaces, logos, and trademarks reproduced through the system, as well as all content other than the Partner's content.

### 15. LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION

The Partner is responsible and bears the risk for the integration to the Products, APIs etc.

In no event shall a Party be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages, including lost profits, of any kind regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, liability of damages (including negligence), strict liability, or otherwise.

[Vipps MobilePay partner terms and conditions](#vipps-mobilepay-partner-terms-and-conditions).

Version: 2.0

### VILKÅR FOR PARTNERE

Vilkårene regulerer forpliktelser i forbindelse med Partners
distribusjon, klargjøring, installering og integrering for bruk av
Vipps' («Selskapets») produkter («Produktene») til relevante målgrupper
og potensielle Brukersteder.  

### 1. DEFINISJONER

**Selskapet: Vipps AS org. nr 918 713 867.**  Vipps er et
norskregistrert betalingsforetak med konsesjon fra Finansdepartementet.
Selskapet tilbyr et bredt spekter av betalings- og
registreringstjenester, og er underlagt tilsyn fra Finanstilsynet i
henhold til finansforetaksloven §2-10.

**Brukersted:** Juridisk person, registrert i Enhetsregisteret eller
tilsvarende offentlig register innenfor EØS-området som benytter
Selskapets Produkter levert gjennom Partner.

**Partner:** Juridisk person, registrert i Enhetsregisteret eller
tilsvarende offentlig register innenfor EØS-området som tilbyr
klargjøring, installering og integrering av Selskapets Produkter levert
til Brukerstedet.

### 2. PARTNERS FORPLIKTELSER

1. Partner skal ha gjennomgått [API checklist på
    github](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner#finishing-the-integration-and-going-live).

2. Partner får en begrenset, ikke-eksklusiv og gjenkallelig rett til å
    markedsføre og formidle Produktene i sin virksomhet i forbindelse
    med klargjøring, installering og integrering for brukersteder. Denne
    retten kan ikke overføres til andre.

3. Partner skal ved varsling om endringer i Selskapets API som medfører
    at Partner må gjøre endringer på sin side, gjennomføre disse innen
    de tidsfrister som settes for produksjonsdato og gjennomføring av
    endring.  

4. Partner skal ikke distribuere eller tilrettelegge Vipps for
    Brukersteder som tilbyr «Ikke tillatte betalinger» i henhold
    til [Selskapets gjeldende vilkår for bedrifter, lag og
    foreninger](https://www.vipps.no/vilkar/vilkar-bedrift/).
    Tilsvarende skal ikke Partner i henhold til tilsvarende vilkår legge
    til rette for at Vipps Logg inn brukes dersom det av lov eller
    praksis følger et høyt krav til sikkerhet og trygghet på at rett
    fysisk person logger inn eller register seg.

5. Brukersteder som driver forretningen i strid med norsk lovgivning,
    foretar salg av varer eller produkter som er forbudt, eller ikke
    blir godkjent i Selskapets kontrollrutiner i henhold til
    brukerstedsvilkårene kan ikke benytte Produktene. Partner har et
    selvstendig ansvar for å vurdere om Brukersteder som ønsker å
    bruke Produktene oppfyller Selskapets vilkår.  Selskapet kan avvise
    brukersteder eller stanse bruk av Produktene iht vilkårene.

6. Partner skal informere Brukersteder om de særskilte vilkår i
    brukerstedsavtale for netthandel og fjernsalg hvor kunden ikke er
    til stede og særskilte vilkår hvor sluttkunden er fysisk til stede
    (Vipps i kasse).

7. Partner skal til enhver tid bruke Selskapets designmanual for å
    presentere logo, farge, design typografi og billedbruk slik at den
    visuelle identiteten, formidling og merkevareopplevelse blir
    tydelig. Den til enhver tid gjeldende designmanual gjøres
    tilgjengelig for Partner via Selskapets nettsider.

8. Selskapets merkevarer skal fremstå som en
    selvstendig(e) merkevare(r). Dette innebærer at Partner kan
    presentere Selskapet sammen med sin egen merkevare, men ikke som
    om Selskapets merkevare(r) er Partners egen merkevare.

9. Partner skal be om godkjennelse av Selskapet dersom Partner
    utarbeider eget materiell eller kommunikasjonsuttak som inkluderer
    Selskapets merkevare.

10. Partner skal ikke gjennomføre betalinger med opprinnelse i salg
    eller aktiviteter som tilbys av et Brukersted eller annen
    tredjepart.

11. Partner skal holde Selskapet løpende orientert om reklamasjoner på
    Produktene, og uten ugrunnet opphold orientere Selskapet dersom det
    skjer en uventet økning i antall reklamasjoner.

12. Partner skal legge til rette for at Brukerstedene skal kunne benytte
    Produktene, bidra til distribusjon av disse og håndtere deler av
    relasjonen til Brukerstedet, inkludert førstelinje support og
    oppfølging av Produktene.

Dersom Partner ikke overholder ovennevnte forpliktelser kan Selskapet
innskrenke muligheten for Partners distribusjon, klargjøring,
installering og integrering for bruk av Produktene.

### 3. NÆRMERE BESKRIVELSE AV PARTNERS PLIKTER

Partner kan være en **plattformpartner** eller en
**integrasjonspartner**. Definisjonen av disse finnes i
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner/#partner-types).

Produktene gjelder alle tilgjengelige i Vipps produkt porteføljen.
Nærmere informasjon om Produktene er tilgjengelige på Selskapets
nettside. Selskapets API finnes i
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/APIs).

Partner kan implementere støtte for ett eller flere av Produktene basert
på de plugins/moduler eller API som Selskapet har gjort tilgjengelig.
Selskapets API og plugins/moduler med tilhørende dokumentasjonen er
Selskapets eiendom også etter integrasjonen, og Selskapet kan fritt
endre disse. Endringer varsles Partner skriftlig eller via Selskapets
nettsider.

### 4. INTEGRASJON

Partner plikter å integrere Produktene i samsvar med de krav og
retningslinjer Selskapet gir samt den tekniske
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner)
Integrasjonen er først ferdig og klar til å gå "live" når Partner har
gjennomført stegene beskrevet i
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner).
Partner har ansvaret for at Produktene integreres og konfigureres
optimalt hos Brukerstedene. Kostnader knyttet til Partners leveranse
avtales direkte mellom Partner og Brukersted.
Partner plikter å bruke Vipps Partner API
når det er behov for å hente informasjon om et Brukersted eller en
salgsenhet.  
Partner plikter å abonnere på Vipps' tekniske nyhetsbrev til utviklere,
tilgjengelig på [Vipps' nettsted for teknisk
dokumentasjon](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner).

### 5. PARTNERNØKLER

Partnere som leverer komplette løsninger til sine brukersteder kan bruke
partnernøkler. Partner får dermed ett sett med API-nøkler til Vipps'
APIer som fungerer for alle sine brukersteder, og det er dermed ikke
nødvendig med individuelle API-nøkler for hvert
brukersted. Partnernøkler kan anvendes til å foreta API-kall på vegne av
Partners brukersteder (dvs. salgsenhetene som er tilknyttet den enkelte
partner). Partner bruker sin egen `client_id` og `client_secret`, og
spesifiserer hvilket brukersted det gjelder ved å bruke brukerstedets
MSN (merchant serial number).  

Partner kan ikke bruke partnernøkler til andre formål enn det som er
beskrevet i
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner/partner-keys/).
Partner er selv ansvarlig for å sikre at partnernøklene ikke blir
publisert eller delt med uautoriserte personer eller med Brukersteder.
Manglende sikring av partnernøkler øker sannsynligheten for svindel og
andre potensielle tap for Partner og Partners brukersteder. Manglende
sikring eller misbruk anses som et brudd på denne avtalen. Selskapet er
ikke ansvarlig for tap som følger av manglende sikring av API-nøkler.

Partner skal kontakte Selskapet umiddelbart dersom man blir oppmerksom
på uautorisert bruk av partnernøklene eller andre brudd på
sikkerheten.

Detaljert informasjon om partnernøkler fremkommer av den til enhver tid
gjeldende tekniske
[Dokumentasjonen](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner/partner-keys/).  

### 6. KRAV TIL FORVALTNING AV INTEGRASJON

Teknisk dokumentasjon for Partner er tilgjengelig på [Vipps' nettsted
for teknisk
dokumentasjon](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner)
under partnersiden.  

1. **Monitorering og retting av feil**

    Partner plikter å monitorere sin bruk av Vipps API-er, inkludert
    registrering av eventuelle feilmeldinger fra API-et. Dersom Selskapet
    oppdager feil bruk av API-ene må Partner rette feilene senest 30 dager
    etter skriftlig varsel. Hvis feilene ikke er rettet etter 30 dagers
    varsel forbeholder Selskapet seg retten til å avslutte partnerforholdet
    med umiddelbar virkning.

2. **Utfasing og endringer av API**

    Dersom Partner ikke oppdaterer sitt system som anvist av Selskapet,
    garanterer ikke Selskapet for at Produktene fungerer. Ved utfasing av et
    API vil forrige versjon fungere i en periode som beskrevet i "Vipps API
    Lifecycle". Samme sted er det dokumentert hva som er \"breaking change\"
    og hva som ikke er det.  

    Plugins/moduler/integrasjoner som en Partner har utviklet basert på
    Selskapets API slutter å fungere når det aktuelle API fases ut eller det
    gjøres vesentlige endringer.  

3. **Generelt om Plugin for Integrasjonspartnere**

    Selskapet vil løpende vurdere hvilke plattformer det tilbys
    plugins/moduler for og når det anses formålstjenlig å iverksette
    nødvendig arbeid for å etablere offisielle plugins/moduler for en
    plattform. Selskapet vil informere Partner når ny offisiell plugin
    gjøres tilgjengelig. Partnere og Brukersteder oppfordres til å ta i bruk
    offisiell plugin/modul når Selskapet tilbyr dette.

4. **Selskapets plugin**

    Selskapet er kun ansvarlig for løpende vedlikehold og oppgraderinger av
    Selskapets egne plugins/moduler. Gjeldene oversikt over Selskapets
    offisielle plugins moduler finnes
    [her](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/plugins).
    Selskapet vil løpende informere Partner om endringer i eksisterende
    plugins/moduler. Endringer som medfører at Brukerstedet må gjøre
    endringer på sin side, vil varsles til både Partner og Brukerstedet
    samtidig, sammen med planlagt produksjonsdato for ny versjon.  

    Partner plikter å oppgradere til nyeste versjon av plugins og moduler
    senest 60 dager etter at de er gjort tilgjengelige. Dersom Brukerstedet
    velger å ikke oppdatere sitt system som anvist av Selskapet, garanterer
    ikke Selskapet for at Produktene fungerer.  

5. **Partners plugin(s)**

    Partner som har utviklet egne plugins/moduler/integrasjoner skal løpende
    videreutvikle disse i henhold til de mulighetene og forbedringene som
    gjøres tilgjengelig i Selskapets API jf punkt 4.1. Ved større endringer
    i Produktene, f.eks. ved at et API fases ut og/eller plugins/moduler
    lanseres, oppfordres Partner til å anbefale Brukerstedene å gå over til
    Selskapets offisielle plugins, hvis slike finnes.

### 7. ONBOARDING AV BRUKERSTED

Partner skal bruke en av Selskapets prefererte metoder for å onboarde
brukersteder som beskrevet på [Vipps' nettsted for teknisk
dokumentasjon](https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/partner).
