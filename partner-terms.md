## 1. SCOPE

The Vipps MobilePay Partner Terms and Conditions ("the Partner Terms") is a legally binding contract between Partner and Vipps MobilePay entered into when Partner accepts the Partner Terms.

The Partner Terms regulate the obligations connected to the Partner's distribution, installment, integration and support for use of the Products for relevant target groups and Merchants. The Partner Terms supersede any previous agreement between Vipps MobilePay and the Partner governing the same subject matter.

The Products are dependent on Vipps MobilePay maintaining the required license(s) with the relevant Financial Supervisory Authorities.

Vipps MobilePay and the Partner are each referred to as a "Party" and jointly as "Parties".

## 2. DEFINITIONS

The following definitions are used in the Partner Terms

**Confidential Information:** (i) information concerning Vipps MobilePay, including information regarding its employees, products, services, customers, suppliers, contractors and other third parties conducting business with Vipps MobilePay and (ii) any information which according to applicable law is confidential. Information does not have to be marked as confidential in order to qualify as confidential.

**Documentation** : technical documentation governing the preparation, installment, integration, management and use of the Products delivered to the Merchant, including API documentation. Documentation is available on the Vipps MobilePay website.
